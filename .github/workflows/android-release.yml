      # If you have signing configs set up in build.gradle with secrets, this will produce a signed APK.
      # Otherwise, it might produce an unsigned one.
      # For a simple hobby project, we can sign it here with a debug key or use the Android Signing Action if needed.
      # Assuming the user handles signing in build.gradle or is okay with unsigned for now.
      # Let's add a step to sign with a debug key if no release key is found, or just upload what's built.
